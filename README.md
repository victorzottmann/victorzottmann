### Hey everyone! 👋

My name is Victor Zottmann and I'm a Full-Stack Developer based in Sydney, Australia. I've been coding since 2020 and have a passion for the creative arts, design, and education. My previous career was in sound design for visual media, where I had the opportunity to work with documentaries and 360 videos. In my spare time you'll find me practising photography 📷, enjoying some movies and tv shows 🎬, playing chess ♞, and going out for a walk 🚶‍♂️.
